This is a plugin that provides an easy way to copy to the clipboard the Prototype link to a specific frame without having to switch into the Presentation mode.

How To Use:
Select a layer and run the command 'Copy Prototype Link' and the link will be copied to the clipboard. When you first start the plugin in a File you will need to set the File Key on the Settings window manually. Just copy the whole File URL from the browser's address bar and paste it to the input field and the plugin will extract the File Key automatically. You also can paste only the File Key to the input field.

The File URL looks like:
https://figma.com/file/e9z7p5lisUPmRe9z7p5lisUPm/FileName

Your file share link is saved in your File safely. It’s not sent to any external server.
